# Vulnerability Report

## Static Analysis (SonarQube) - Expected Findings
- Hardcoded credentials in `config.py`
- Use of outdated dependencies (e.g., Flask 1.0 instead of Flask 2.x)

## Dynamic Analysis (OWASP ZAP) - Expected Findings
- XSS vulnerabilities in form inputs
- Missing security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy)

Since SonarQube did not run successfully, these vulnerabilities are expected findings based on manual code review and security best practices.
